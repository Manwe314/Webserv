To-Do:

    1. Finish the Response class. - Levan
    2. Figure out CGI. - Brett
    3. compleate the config file parsing and config class functionality.
    4. Figure out possible bugs (bind, config parseing, etc.). - Brett
    5. Handle chunked requests.



    things to remember:
        1. chunking
        2. URI queries
        3. proxy functionality
        4. multiple port support.
        5. the headers sent in probably are important :P
        6. handle file permisions to have accutate status codes
        7. cacheing.
        8. POST is used for proxy and cgi purposes, if said directives are not present then the behaviour is server dependant.
            since the subject asks us to take nginx as referance, nginx will treat this POST request as a GET request without the body.
        9. DELETE should be able to delete both full and empty directories, or maybe no?
