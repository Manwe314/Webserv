To-Do:

    1. Figure out possible bugs (bind, config parseing, etc.). - Brett/Levan
    2. Handle chunked requests. - testing in progress
	3. CGI headers process
	4. CGI tester check
	5. Adding visual tests for POST/PUT, upload = Levan
	6. Adding visual tests for CGI GET and POST scripts. Also a bash script that sends a lot of script GET requests to a server to see resistance
